# Advanced-Data-Processing-Techniques-for-Efficient-Searching-Clustering-and-Embedding
This repository contains code snippets that showcase some advanced data processing techniques for efficient searching, clustering, and embedding.

# Indexing with Faiss:
This code snippet demonstrates how to use Faiss to index images based on their vector representations obtained from a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The indexed images can be efficiently searched for the most similar images to a given query image. The code first loads the image dataset and CNN model, generates vector representations for each image, creates a Faiss index, adds the image vectors to the index, generates a query vector for a given query image, and searches for the most similar images in the index. Finally, the code displays the most similar images to the query image.

# Embeddings with Elasticsearch:
This code snippet demonstrates how to use Elasticsearch to index sentences based on their embeddings obtained from a language model. The indexed sentences can be efficiently searched for the most similar sentences to a given query sentence. The code first loads the sentence dataset and language model, generates embeddings for each sentence, connects to Elasticsearch, creates an index, adds the sentence embeddings to the index, generates a query embedding for a given query sentence, retrieves the most similar sentences from the index, and finally displays the most similar sentences to the query sentence.

# Clustering with K-means and SQLite:
This code snippet demonstrates how to use K-means to cluster customer purchase histories and store the cluster information in a SQLite database. The code first loads the customer purchase history dataset and K-means model, generates cluster labels for each customer, creates a SQLite database and table to store the customer vectors and clusters, inserts the customer vectors and clusters into the SQLite database, retrieves the customers in each cluster from the database, and finally displays the customers in each cluster.

# Dependencies:
The code requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Python 3
numpy
faiss
Elasticsearch
transformers
sklearn
sqlite3
Usage:

To run the code snippets, download the required dataset and model files, install the dependencies, and run the Python scripts. You can modify the scripts according to your own datasets and models.
